[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]Hello, I'm Nate, one of the park rangers here.
[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]I understand that your son Finn went missing on this trail about an hour ago.
[NAME=The Mother][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheMother]Yes! He just disappeared.
[NAME=The Sister][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheSister]He ran ahead of us to the campsite, but when we got there we couldn't find him.
[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]Okay. Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
[NAME=The Sister][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheSister]No, none at all. 
[NAME=The Sister][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheSister]We looked everywhere we could on the way back to the parking lot, but there was no sign of him.
[NAME=The Sister][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheSister]We told him to stay on the trail. Ugh, he never listens!
[NAME=The Father][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheFather]He's always getting into trouble.
[NAME=The Mother][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheMother]He's just confused! He doesn't mean to!
[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]Don't worry, I know how kids are.
[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]There are a few blocked off trails near the campsite that he might have wandered down.
[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]I'll radio in if I find anything. The park ranger at the Visitor Center will keep you updated.
[NAME=The Father][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheFather]Aren't there more of you?
[NAME=Nate][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheHiker]Unfortunately, no. We're very short staffed at the moment. But I promise you I'll do my best to find your son.
[NAME=The Mother][SPEAKERSPRITE=TheMother]Thank you, thank you! Please bring him home!
